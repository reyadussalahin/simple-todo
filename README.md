# Simple Todo

Simple todo is a very minimalistic todo app which demonstrates how to build an web application from scratch using `Object Oriented PHP`. No framework has been used to built this webapp, still it contains all the basic needs those are provided by frameworks such as `Routing Engine`, `Pretty url support`, `Middleware support(both route specific and general)`, `Named Routes`, `A minimalistic template engine`, `Controllers`, `CSRF protection` etc.  
  
This webapp tries to show that how one can easily build a very well designed webapp without the need of web framework.

Also, the frontend of the webapp is built using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No framework has been used on the frontend.

For testing purposes, I've used PHPUnit. It is the only third party library which has been used and also a small script has been used from [devcoder-xyz/php-dotenv](https://github.com/devcoder-xyz/php-dotenv) to parse dotenv file.
